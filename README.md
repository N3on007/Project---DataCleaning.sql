# Project---DataCleaning.sql
Data Cleaning Project with SQL

Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive data cleaning techniques using SQL to transform raw, messy datasets into analysis-ready formats. The project addresses common data quality issues and provides reusable solutions for similar data preprocessing challenges.

Objectives

Clean and standardize raw datasets for analysis
Handle missing values and null data appropriately
Remove duplicate records and inconsistencies
Validate data quality and integrity
Document the entire cleaning process for reproducibility

ðŸ”§ Data Issues Addressed
1. Missing Values-
Identified null values across all columns
Applied appropriate strategies (imputation, removal, or flagging)
Documented assumptions made for each handling method

2. Duplicate Records-
Detected exact and near-duplicate entries
Implemented deduplication logic
Preserved data integrity during removal process

3. Data Type Issues-
Corrected inappropriate data types
Standardized date formats
Converted text to proper numeric formats

4. Inconsistent Formatting-
Standardized text case (upper/lower)
Cleaned special characters and whitespace
Unified naming conventions

5. Data Validation

Implemented range checks for numeric fields
Validated foreign key relationships
Ensured referential integrity
